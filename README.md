Project Title:
CI/CD Pipeline Simulation in Java

Description:
This is a simple Java program that simulates the steps of a CI/CD pipeline. It prints messages indicating the progress of the build process:

Compiling Java code:
Building a Docker image (simulated)
Completion of the pipeline
The program is designed for educational and demonstration purposes, showing how a CI/CD pipeline could provide feedback during automated builds.

Requirements:
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
Command line terminal or any Java IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse)

How to Compile:
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt in the directory containing CICDProcess.java:

text:
javac CICDProcess.java
This will produce a CICDProcess.class file.

How to Run:
Execute the compiled Java program with:

text
java CICDProcess
Expected Output
text
Step 1: Compiling Java code...
Java compilation successful.
Step 2: Building Docker image...
(Simulated) docker build -t my-app:latest .
Docker build simulated.
CI/CD pipeline completed.
Usage
The program simulates compilation success by default.

To simulate a compilation failure, modify the simulateJavaCompile() method in the source code to return false.
